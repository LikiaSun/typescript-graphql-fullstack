# NO SOUL WEB

> Exploit own fullstack in this nobody shit just for no fun

### Technical use

- Front-end: **React**
  Althought I know how to use **Vue**„ÄÅ**Angular** and **Svelte**. But cause I can use React write clean code well and that beautiful function component alse hook, so... I choose React

- Back-end: **Apollo-express-server, TypeORM**
  I like Apollo server's tools and TypeORM define is so good.

- Database: **Postgres, Redis, Neo4j(Maybe)**
  I know how to use **MongoDB** or **MySQL**, but I think postgres is much better in Shopping web.

- DevOps: **Docker, Circle Ci, AWS**
  Don't care about that. That's all I can use.
